    <h3>Why linux?</h3>
    <p>Linux is a free and open source operating system!</p>
    <h4> What does open source mean?</h4>
    <p>It means that all of its code is public for everyone to see! Leading to massive security and stablity benifits.</p>
    <p>You might think that giving up the code of the OS will make it insecure since Microsoft and other big name developers don't share theirs. This privacy model is called "Security Through Obscurity" and has been proven innefective on multiple occasions.</p>
    <p>By having your operating system open, it allows for third party researchers to evaluate the code behind the operating system for your benifit and theirs. As generally these security researchers are hired by big companies that use linux to protect their data, and all the benifits are then trickled out to everyone!</p>
